# What it does
The app lets workers (employees) to report incidents relating to an equipment. When a worker starts his day at work, he opens up the app, adds equipments to his list, and updates the status of the equipment at the end of the day. This way, the equipment health is monitered daily with legit updates. During the day, if there happens any damage to the equipment which is dangerous to work with the, the worker goes to the app and creates a Incident. The supervisor will be let know of this activity, and reviews the incident and updates the status of the incident.

# How we built it
The mobile app is built using react-native.

# Challenges we ran into
Firebase being nosql database, we had to reconstruct the database that we drew, originally which was prepared considered the sql way.
Relationship between the tables in the database
# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Four screens with a team of 5 in less than a day could lead to many git conflicts, but we worked out with avoiding conflicts and managing the git
Learning react native in less than a day and designing style
Running the app via many different kinds of emulators (iOS, andriod, browser)
# What we learned
everything about firebase
that react native is fun
styling
relational tables in the DB
tree structure of the code
understanding and configuring react native libraries
use of Figma to design the screens
# What's next for Team Hacktober Mohys
